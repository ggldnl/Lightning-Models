    # Each sequence is mapped to a list of vectors by the embedding layer.
    # We need to convey to the model information on the position of each
    # token inside the sequence. To do so, to each token we sum another
    # embedding vector of the same size that encodes the position of the
    # token in the sequence. The sequences have a fixed maximum length,
    # so we can compute the position embedding vectors once and reuse
    # them for every sequence during training and inference.

        # On the paper, the formula used to compute the position embedding is the following:

        #   PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / (10000 ^ (2i / d_model)))

        # We implement the same formula in log space to increase numerical stability.
        #
        # Numerical stability refers to how a malformed input affects the execution
        # of an algorithm and to the goodness of an implementation of a function.
        # We can't implement a function perfectly in an algorithm due to various
        # approximation errors introduced along the way (how we store numbers and
        # so on). Our implementation of a function will take the same input value
        # and will map it to some other value with respect to the expected value
        # (f_impl(x) != f(x)). If the function we are implementing is very sensitive
        # to small changes (it's conditioning is bad -> ill-conditioned) then a small
        # change in the input may result in a large change in the output.
